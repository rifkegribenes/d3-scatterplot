## Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph (Freecodecamp Project)

### Live: http://rifkegribenes-d3-scatterplot.surge.sh/

#### User stories:

* I can see data visualized in a scatterplot graph.
* I can mouse over a plot to see a tooltip with additional details.

#### Data Source:
The recommended data source for this project (doping allegations in bicycle racing) was boring to me so I used a different one. This graph plots life expectancy at birth against income inequality (Gini coefficient) and GDP.
